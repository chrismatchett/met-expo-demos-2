# Belfast Met - IoT App Development

## Overview
Mobile App Design and IoT are two of the most exciting areas of Technology. In this class you will learn how to create a Mobile App. You will programme your new App to control IoT sensors and devices. You will create your App using React Native. React Native is a popular framework maintained by Facebook that enables cross-platform native apps using JavaScript. Some knowledge of programming and Javascript is recommended but not essential.

## Troubleshooting
The Met computers are blocking tunneling to the Expo App. To setup Expo on your own laptop you will need the following software.

* Node LTS version, https://nodejs.org/en/
* Git, https://git-scm.com/
* Visual Studio Code, https://code.visualstudio.com/

## Classwork

### Exercise 1

Once you have the software above installed follow the Set up section in the Expo documentation to get up and running.

* https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/

### Exercise 2

Now you are up and running with Expo work your way through their Tutorial

* https://docs.expo.dev/tutorial/planning/

### Exercise 3

We will learn how to layout components in our App.

* Copy the code from ./00-ShapesColours.js to your ./App.js file and test it works.
* Edit this code to recreate the layout in the graphic file, ./assets/layout.png.
* Get your ./App.js code to look as much like the graphic as possible.

### Exercise 4

We will learn how to use Git to store revisions of our code and share our code with the rest of the Class.

Follow the instructions in the following article to push your existing Expo folder to a new Git Repository.

Some notes about Git

* Your .gitignore file means certain files and folders are excluded from your repository e.g. node_modules. 
* Programmers don't want you to publish all your node modules and dependencies.
* Your package.json file documents the packages required by your App.
* ```npx expo install``` will install the packaged and dependencies for your project.
